CVE-ID: EDU-JUICESHOP-2026-T06-001

Title: Authentication Bypass via SQL Injection in OWASP Juice Shop

Affected Lab: OWASP Juice Shop | Container: websploit-juice-shop | Port: 3000

Component: User Authentication Module

Severity: Critical

CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

CVSS Score: 9.8

Description:
The login functionality of the OWASP Juice Shop application is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The application fails to properly sanitize the email input field before incorporating it into a backend SQL query. An unauthenticated attacker can supply specially crafted SQL syntax to manipulate the query logic. By using a tautology (e.g., ' or 1=1--), the attacker can bypass password verification and authenticate as the first user in the database (typically the administrator) without a valid password.

Proof of Concept:

Target URL: http://10.6.6.12:3000/#/login

Payload (Email): ' or 1=1--

Password: Any arbitrary string

Result: The SQL query becomes something like SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = '' OR 1=1--' AND password = '...'. Since 1=1 is always true and -- comments out the rest of the query, the application logs the attacker in as the administrator.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Open juice-shop using the following url : http://10.6.6.12:3000

2. Go to the login section

3. Enter ' or 1=1-- in the email/username section and enter a random password

4. You are now logged in

Remediation:

1. Parameterized Queries: Use prepared statements (with parameterized queries) for all database access to ensure input is treated as data, not executable code.

2. Input Validation: Implement a strict allowlist for email formats.

3. ORM Security: Use secure settings in Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks like Sequelize (which Juice Shop uses) to avoid raw queries.

4. Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure the database user has minimal permissions required for the application to function.
